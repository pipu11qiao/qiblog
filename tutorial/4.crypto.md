##### class: hash
The ==Hsh== class is a utility for creating hash digests of data. It can be used in one of two ways:

* As a steam that is both readable and writable,where data is written to produce a computed hash digest on the readable side,or
* Using the hash.update() and hash.digest() methods to produce the computed hash.

##### methods:
* hash.digest([encoding]);// 'hex','latin1','base64'
* + hash object can not be user again after hash.digest() method has been called; 
* hash.update(data,[,input_encoding]);

#### crypto.getHashes();
Returns an array of the names of the supported hash algorithms;
