### 1.安装express-generator 
	express应用生成器
### 命令行创建项目
	* express -e pipublog
	* cd pipublog && npm install
	* set DEBUG=pipublog:* & npm star 
	* 浏览器打开 localhost:3000 就能访问页面
### debug 模块 	
	var debug = require('debug') //-> 返回一个函数，接收一个名字，用来标示当前输出的模块
	debug exposes a function; simply pass this function the name of your module, 
	and it will return a decorated version of console.error for you to pass debug statements to. 
	This will allow you to toggle the debug output for different parts of your module as well as 
	the module as a whole.
	If you're using this in one or more of your libraries, you should use the name of your library
	 so that developers may toggle debugging as desired without guessing names. If you have more
	  than one debuggers you should prefix them with your library name and use ":" to separate features.
	   For example "bodyParser" from Connect would then be "connect:bodyParser".
